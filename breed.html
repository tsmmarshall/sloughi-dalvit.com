            <p class="lead text-primary">The Sloughi is a natural breed. For natural breeds in general, the following characteristics are typical:</p>
            <ul class="custom p-0">
               <li>shyness</li>
               <li>low trainability</li>
               <li>aversion to coercion</li>
               <li>lack of concentration</li>
               <li>unbound hunting instincts</li>
               <li>aversion to drill exercise</li>
               <li>high intelligence</li>
               <li>excellent memory</li>
               <li>high problem-solving ability (except for more complex purchases and quadratic equations)</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="justify"><b>It follows that dogs of natural breeds are not dogs for everyone - only for:</b><br />
               responsible, informed and dedicated dog lovers.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
               <p align="justify">The Sloughi probably originated in the territory of present-day Morocco, Tunis or Libya. He was probably given to the Orient as a gift to Nubian pharaohs from areas of present-day Asia. At that time, however, the Sloughi was different from what we know today. He has reached his present form 7-8 centuries BC. The Sloughi became a companion on the travels of nomadic Berber tribes who inhabited northern Africa.</p>
               <cite title="Source Title">Wikipedie</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Shyness</h4>
            <p>This is not meant to be a labile nervous system, but rather to be cautious and distrustful of strangers, as well as anything new and unusual. Without this caution, a wild dog in its homeland would not survive.</p>
            <h4>Low trainability</h4>
            <p align="justify">Natural breeds are reported to be difficult to train. But it is rather a question of the method and motivation used. The Sloughi is neither a German shepherd nor a poodle - the coercive methods do not work here, rather the opposite. The Sloughi must enjoy exercising - then learns everything very quickly. Adding kindness and consistency to good motivation will also be obedient.</p>
            <p align="justify">For a handy trainer who understands canine behaviour, it is a pleasure to practice with the Sloughi and teach them something. In my personal experience, the Sloughi is very understanding and many exercises will learn even faster than other so-called "easy to train" breeds used for service training.</p>
            <p align="justify">Everyday fun exercises associated with play and rewards are beneficial for both the dog and its owner. It strengthens the relationship; the owner learns to understand the dog's way of thinking and behaviour. The dog is looking forward to such exercises - it is a welcome variegation of life. Agility training is probably best suited for the Sloughi, as the training methodology is based solely on positive methods.</p>
            <h4>Forced aversion</h4>
            <p align="justify">Especially puppies are very sensitive to it, hard to get used to collar, to leash, hardly tolerate any restriction of their freedom. Violence will not achieve anything; great patience is needed. In no case can a coercive method be used in learning. Learn them only by play and treats. Coercion - for example, squeeze the back of a sit-down command sees the Sloughi as very unpleasant, so we will use it only as a punishment for not listening to the learned sit-up command, but not in learning it.</p>
            <h4>Insufficient concentration</h4>
            <p align="justify">The Sloughi is very inattentive, constantly observing his surroundings, so that he will not miss anything, he is interested in everything - just not in his trainer. Concentration, however, can be learned and trained - for example see Agility Training Methodology.</p>
            <h4>Untied hunting instincts</h4>
            <p align="justify">The persecution of everything that is moving is inherited for the Sloughi, it's a natural need. It is very difficult or impossible to achieve 100% obedience in this respect. It is not possible to punish a dog for that. The solution is training on a long line, letting the dog only in safe places, see the game before she and summon her in time. The innate instinct of persecution of prey can the Sloughi work off on the racetrack - in classic races or coursing.</p>
            <h4>Aversion to drill exercises</h4>
            <p align="justify">Not only learning must enjoy the Sloughi but also every exercise. You can't want him to sit, lie down or stop 10 times in a row. A group exercise of basic obedience at the cynological training Sloughi usually does not impress. Exercise must be varied, interesting, with breaks filled by play. He loves and looks forward to it.</p>
            <h4>High intelligence, memory and problem-solving ability</h4>
            <p align="justify">The intelligence of the Sloughi is characterized by the ability to solve problems in their own way and for their own benefit - it is the result of a long evolution in their homeland, where had to rely solely on themselves. Natural breeds with their intelligence excel over all other more breeds of dogs. But beware! High intelligence dog is not always an advantage for the owner. Much better everyone can handle a stupid dog. Stupid dog is "not angry".</p>
            <p align="justify">Smart dog has a high need for ever new impressions, experiences, requires a colourful job. If all the owner does not provide enough, the dog will be bored and will be forced to ensure the satisfaction of its psychological needs himself - such as escape, roaming, devising all sorts of "mischief", etc.</p>
            <p align="justify">Excellent memory can also be a disadvantage for the owner. Just one failure of your nerves, one rude treatment or punishment of the so-called "delayed" (i.e. other than at the time of unwanted activity - dogs retain awareness of a particular action only 1/2 to 2 seconds - i.e. the dog does not understand that he is punished for something he committed five minutes ago (about half an hour or half of day rather not to mention) and the behaviour of the dog is thus marked for several years and for life. The Sloughi also has an excellent spatial memory and orientation. Even if he runs, never gets strayed, never gets lost. He will always return to the place where he escaped, even from the far opposite side.</p>
            <p align="justify">But he also remembers the tempting carrion or the junkyard of the pig slaughtering that you walked a week ago, and if he thinks, he will jump to check on it, even this time going in a completely different way.</p>
            <p align="justify">For a very long time he remembers the people with whom once had become friends with (or even antagonized). Puppies, which leave the world at nine weeks of age, safely recognize their breeder even in adulthood.</p>
            <p align="justify">Also, the ability to solve problems is not rated positively by every owner. Solve problems, i.e. quickly figure out how to open the door, the trash can be opened by pressing the pedal, etc. But who can appreciate the intelligence of own dog and enjoy it, who enjoys inventing his dog fun, teach him different tricks, who enjoy thinking how to outwit his dog, instead of physically punishing him, he will be excited by the Sloughi and will never be bored with this dog.</p>
            <p align="justify">Who once lived with the Sloughi and fell in love with them, then seems every other breed uninteresting.</p>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="justify">The Sloughi has lived for centuries in close contact with its master, his family. Slept with his master in a tent, often under the same blanket, participated in children's games, accompanied his family everywhere. The close relationship with the master and family is firmly anchored in the nature of the Sloughi. Therefore, the Sloughi is:</p>
            <ul class="custom p-0">
               <li>Extremely nice family dog, affectionate, cuddly and playful</li>
               <li>He has an excellent relationship with children</li>
               <li>Very strong relationship with family members (therefore cannot change owner in adulthood</u>)</li>
               <li>Needs to be constantly with its own people</li>
               <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

               <p align="justify">Before you decide to get your puppy the Sloughi, think well whether you are willing and able to devote maximum time to your puppy, whether you are willing to overcome your comfort in raising a puppy. Lots of love, patience, cuddling, games and good feeding are far from enough. Good socialization is extremely important. During the so-called "imprinting phase", which lasts from about three to sixteen weeks of age, decisively shaped the future nature and behaviour of an adult dog. It is necessary to use every day and the puppy to meet strangers, children, strange dogs, pets, street noise, different environments. Ideal are crowded marketplaces, parks in large cities, where meet dogs and freely run all the kind dogs</p>
               <p align="justify">It is possible that you have grown several dogs of other breeds without this intensive special education, and yet they were ideal and trouble-free companions. It's different with the Sloughi. Although the puppy has an inherited excellent character, without good socialization it will not be an ideal companion.</p>
               <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
               <p align="justify">How does a well socialized Sloughi look like? Feel free to let him go in any large park - strange dogs do not fight, run after runners, ignore people. At the show behaves sovereignly, lets the judge palpate, examine teeth. He is guarding at home, but if you invite a visit in, he will calm down in a while and usually be allowed to caress. No hunting chickens, chasing sheep, become friends with family cats. No problems traveling with you by car, train, bus and tram, you can take it everywhere. He is certainly worth sacrificing maximum, every day to puppies in their 4 months intensively devote and then even 15 years to enjoy an excellent companion.</p>
               <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
               <p align="justify">Natural breeds have preserved all original instincts and behaviours - just like their wild ancestors. They have good health, trouble-free deliveries, excellent maternal behaviour. If there are several Sloughi in the family, he is very interesting to observe social behaviour in the pack. The most beautiful and most interesting is the period of rearing puppies, when the puppies take care of the pack. At first, the mother will not let any dog close to her offspring. But when puppies open their eyes and start to walk, they are not so worried about them and leave some care to others. Especially young bitches - aunties are enthusiastic about puppies, they wear toys and they can play with them all day, if puppies are not sleeping. When the mother's milk is no longer enough for the puppies, the mother and father spew their food, even if the breeder feeds the puppies no matter how well. It is always better from a mother or other pack member than from a bowl. He is touching to observe when a member of the pack brings puppies a treat that received. Mother does it routinely. Especially happy to bring puppies a larger piece of raw meat. Once I gave each dog a freshly killed rabbit with skin. The father of the puppies picked up the rabbits from all the adult dogs, brought them to the puppies and tore them to them ‚Äì carve up them to eat them. Thus, the cubs care for wolves or dingoes, dogs of high-breed breeds can no longer do this.</p>
               <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
               <p align="justify">Different breeders have different opinions and different breeding goals; therefore, the breeding of individual breeders can be quite different. For the breed as a whole, it is only good. There are two counterparts:</p>
               <p align="justify"><strong>a)</strong> breeders whose primary breeding objective is "exhibition of the Sloughi". They focus on the highest subtlety and nobility, as much as possible to emphasize typical features and proportions. Their offspring wins mostly on shows with an overview. The fastest and safest way to this end is kinship liner breeding. </p>
               <p align="justify"><strong>b)</strong> breeders whose most important breeding objective is to preserve the breed in its original form for future generations. They pay particular attention to good character, good health and, from the exterior point of view, a typical look, elegance, but without functional exaggeration. They prefer unrelated links, use direct imports in breeding to revive blood and preserve the breed's genetic diversity</p>
               <p align="justify">Of course, not all breeders can be divided into these two boxes, not all have such a distinctive opinion.</p>
               <p align="justify">If you are considering buying a puppy, you should clarify what you are buying your puppy for, what is most important for you and choose from which breeder and from which connection you choose the puppy. Whether exhibition success or good nature is the most important for you, good health. It is impossible to want everything at once. Super champion with excellent character and strong health, it rarely happens. If you plan to import a puppy from abroad, consult with a breeding advisor first. If you manage to bring a puppy that is not related to the Sloughi in the Czech Republic, you will prove our breeding a great service.</p>
