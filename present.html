            <p align="justify">This website was created on the occasion of my anniversary. I wanted them for my birthday. All my life revolves around animals, mostly and for the longest time around dogs. I think logically and recap. So when someone asks me about the future of our breeding, I can't answer just in three sentences. To help, I take Karel Capek, his text from the book I had a dog and a cat, as published in the Czechoslovak writer in 1983:</p>
                  <ul class="custom pl-0">
                     <li>All puppies are the same; all are born with the same habits and grow according to the same rules of the game. They all climb to the places where they should not, they do seventy-seven puddles a day, tear people stockings, eat what they don't have, such as chairs, strings, soap, carpets and fingers, sleep in a clean laundry basket, call for help every five minutes, learn to bark and they are quiet only when they do some irreparable damage. All this is inevitable natural law, valid for all puppies in the world.</li>
                     <li>In contrast, each puppy is different from birth in terms of masks, abilities and mental habit. One puppy is born as a thoughtful and reflective creature; the second one is from the first day a brawler, reckless, and conqueror; the third one is a howling and eternally offended self-lover; the fourth one is good and calm. The puppies are choleric, melancholic, sangvinic and phlegmatic; characters pycnic and ambivalent, heroic and rascal; there are puppies of action and puppies sentimental, natures of Achilles and Odyssey, temperaments hot and cold, closed personalities and sociable character. All puppies do the same, but each differently. Eternal is the infinite variety of everything that lives.</li>
            <p align="justify">Breeding and dogs in general are not just a hobby for us, thanks to our work also daily bread, lifestyle, they are part of our lives, of our family. We will never be breeders who buy an animal for profit. Generally this is not even possible for decent people, for sloughi it is then excluded :-). </p>
